Project Description:
Analyzing water system operating permits for patterns, trends, and anomalies in issued permits across mechanical system types, compliance, and contamination levels.

Project Title:
Exploratory Analysis of Water System Operating Permits

Objective:
To identify trends in permit issuance, voluntary compliance, and contamination metrics for improving regulatory focus and operational priorities.

Dataset:
472 entries detailing operating permits for water systems, including mechanical system types, compliance status, geographical data, contamination metrics, and renewal dates.

Methodology:

Perform descriptive statistics (means, medians, frequencies).
Visualize data with histograms, scatter plots, and trend charts.
Identify missing data, anomalies, and correlations between variables.
Tools and Technologies:

AWS Data Brew for data profiling
AWS Glue for ETL pipeline
Amazon S3 for data storage
Visualization tools (e.g., Excel or Matplotlib)
Deliverables:

Summary statistics
Visualizations of permit trends and contamination data
Insights into compliance and system types
